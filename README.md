## Overview

Connect Four is a two-player game.

Player one plays with the black pieces, Player 2 with the white pieces. Players take turns dropping a piece from the top into a seven-column, six-row grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The goal of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own pieces.
