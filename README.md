## Overview

Connect Four is a two-player game.

Player one plays with the black pieces, Player 2 with the white pieces. Players take turns dropping a piece from the top into a seven-column, six-row grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The goal of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own pieces.

## Features

-   When a player wins, a message appears to announce the victory.
-   The victory message has an animation that shows the direction (vertical, horizontal, or diagonal) that won the game.
-   After a player wins, it is possible to reset the game and play again.
-   Every time a piece falls, it makes a sound.
